<p>The agenda of the tutorial will be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Place</strong>: Polytechnico di Torino</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong>: Friday, September 22<sup>nd</sup> 2023, afternoon (GMT+1)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Machine learning algorithms have become indispensable in today’s world. They support and accelerate the way we make decisions based on the data at hand. This acceleration means that data structures that were valid at a moment could no longer be valid in the future. With these changing data structures, it is necessary to adapt machine learning (ML) systems incrementally to the new data. This is done with the use of online learning or continuous ML technologies. While Deep Learning technologies have shown exceptional performance on predefined datasets, they have not been widely applied to online, streaming and continuous learning. This tutorial illustrates with the frameworks <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code> the opportunities, but also the potential pitfalls for the application of neural networks in online learning environments.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: stream learning, concept drift, data stream mining, incremental modelling, online deep learning, neural networks, decision support</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>Having algorithms at hand that can process data that arrives continuously in the form of data streams is crucial. 
Online Learning potentially has to deal with real-time data rather than previously known data sets. 
To deal with the evaluation and application of models on data streams, Bifet et al. [5] defined the online learning requirements as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Process an instance at a time, and inspect it (at most) once.</li>
  <li>Use a limited amount of time to process each instance.</li>
  <li>Use a limited amount of memory.</li>
  <li>Be ready to give an answer (e.g. prediction) at any time</li>
  <li>Adapt to temporal changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following figure depicts how an online learning framework is able to comply with the data stream requirements for supervised learning tasks. 
The model processes labeled data points $\left(\overrightarrow{x},y\right)$ by updating the model while instead predicting a label $\hat{y}$ for each unlabeled instance $\overrightarrow{x}$. 
Thus, the model processes each instance from an evolving data stream, updates the underlying model, and is ready to predict at any time.</p>

<p>Even until now, the development of stream algorithms is quite scattered and decentralized. Previously, algorithms were usually self-developed and maintained by the respective authors in various different programming languages, with none of the existing frameworks being widely adopted within the online learning community. Currently, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> is becoming not only a go-to library for online machine learning tasks, but also a pioneer framework for the implementation of any new algorithm within the field.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="./stream-structure.png" alt="stream-structure" />
  <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Structure of the interaction between data stream and prediction model.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A significant question in the context of the advancement of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> is whether deep learning algorithms, which have been a staple in many batch learning frameworks for some time, can also fulfill the requirements and therefore be applied within online learning environments. To this end, we developed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code> which combines the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> API for online learning algorithms and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyTorch</code> for the flexible development of neural architectures.
Based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> and the newly developed framework <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code>, we present in this tutorial the chances and pitfalls for online deep learning by</p>
<ul>
  <li>addressing the online learning requirements,</li>
  <li>the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> API and discussing their</li>
  <li>applicability in deep learning architectures.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tutorial will cover the transition from simple conventional machine learning models to sophisticated neural architectures while considering not only classification, regression and anomaly detection metrics, but also time and memory consumption which are key factors for the throughput of the underlying model.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-data-stream-online-machine-learning-and-river">Introduction to data stream (online) machine learning and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code></h2>

<p>We will begin the tutorial by explaining the motivation and necessity of data stream machine learning, which offers a significant advantage compared to traditional machine learning methods when dealing with particularly large or infinite amounts of data with constrained time and resources.</p>

<p>The motivation will lead into the creation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code>, a merge between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Creme</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scikit-multiflow</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> is becoming more and more of a go-to toolkit in the field, with various advantages and many more features offered compared to its competitors. In addition to introducing the fundamental concepts of the framework, we will also provide detailed guidance on how to contribute to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> and teach the participants how to integrate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> into their research.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we will present a comprehensive overview, along with the latest research interests in fairness and interpretability of online machine learning models. 
Due to the fact that stream machine learning models are designed to handle an infinite amount of information while having to preserve accuracy under concept drifts, this is a much younger yet more challenging and interesting research field compared to that of traditional machine learning methods.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-online-deep-learning-and-deep-river">Introduction to online deep learning and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code></h2>

<p>This part will be the main part of the tutorial. 
We will motivate the development of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code> by showing how deep learning models follow the online learning requirements and what adaptations need to be made for classification and regression tasks in supervised learning as well as anomaly detection with autoencoders in an unsupervised learning setting.
An example for such an adaptation is that the usually static architecture of a neural network classifier needs to be adapted to the emergence of previously unseen classes. 
This is due to the fact that in an online learning scenario the total number of classes may not be known at the time of network initialization.</p>

<p>After stating the conceptual specifics for the use of neural networks on evolving data streams, we will look at the implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code> and show how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyTorch</code> models can be integrated into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> API. To illustrate the chances and challenges of online deep learning, we will provide a demonstration of the transition from classical machine learning to deep learning models based on an example data set.</p>

<h1 id="target-audience">Target audience</h1>

<p>The target audience of the tutorial includes any researchers and practitioners with interests in machine learning for big data, evolving data streams and IoT applications.</p>

<p>Basic knowledge of traditional- as well as deep- batch machine learning algorithms and frameworks (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scikit-learn</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TensorFlow</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyTorch</code>) would be helpful. 
Previous interactions with online machine learning packages/tools, for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MOA</code> (in Java), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stream</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scikit-multiflow</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Creme</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> could also be beneficial but are not required.</p>

<p>For any developer who wants to contribute to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code>, or employ either of these two packages within their research work, we recommend a high level of familiarity with version control via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Git</code>, functionalities of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GitHub</code> (e.g. pull requests, issues, a discussion, GitHub Actions) and code formatters in Python (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flake8</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">black</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isort</code>, etc.).</p>

<h1 id="prior-offerings">Prior offerings</h1>

<p>Up to date, to the authors’ knowledge, there has been <strong>no</strong> presented tutorial involving either of the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A detailed investigation into the problem of fairness and interpretability of online machine learning algorithms in general. This will be the main emphasis in our introduction to data stream machine learning, accounting for approximately <strong>50%</strong> of the first part of the tutorial.</li>
  <li>
    <p>In-depth demonstrations of the developing process i.e. on how to develop new algorithms within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code> and how actual previous problems and solutions during the process were resolved.</p>

    <p>This will be followed up by a presentation of the development  and maintenance roadmap of the framework, which is one of the most crucial parts of any open-source projects.</p>

    <p>In other words, this tutorial will be more aimed at developers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The topic of online deep learning will be investigated thoroughly, not only as a literature survey but it is also put into practical contexts, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deep-river</code>. This also serves as the first formal introduction to the software package since its inaugural version in late August 2022.</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, there has been only <strong>two</strong> editions of a tutorial briefly that briefly introduced stream machine learning and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">River</code>’s related use cases, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First offering:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Title:</strong> Online Clustering: Algorithms, Evaluation, Metrics, Applications and Benchmarking using River.</li>
